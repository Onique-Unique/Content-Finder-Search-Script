# Content-Finder-Search-Script

Created a script that will enable me to search within a webpage for existing contents without the use of a database in the backend. 
This script was written to assist with the functionality of a webpage to search within it for available content 
and redirecting content that is not available to a redirect page.

As a problem solver it is with natural intent i try to find solutions and alternatives in its simplest format alllowed. 
I wanted to create a search function on a webpage that will allow the user to find the content searched which is available and redirected if not available.

I came across solutions that were not inline to what i wanted to achieve such as having to create a database that would then essentially function in the terms needed

with this approach i took it upon myself to be resourceful yet again and create an alternative that would then eliminate the need for a database by using arrays and 
call functions, this was essentially what i was aiming to achieve to complete the task within a reasonable timeframe.

You can check the functionality of this code by visiting my website @ www.feenixbloom.com as it is helpdesk and troubleshoot related content it is with best result 
to utilize the search field for such intent.


As of now this script is in its simplest format and will be updated frequently to apply a wider set of arrays to enhance its capabilities with more advance properties.
